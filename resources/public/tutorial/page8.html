<h2 id="triples">Triples</h2>
<p>Now it's time to convert our book data to &quot;triples&quot;, i.e. statements about things to put in our graph. A triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>the subject is the name of a resource: an IRI</li>
<li>the predicate is the name of a relation: also an IRI</li>
<li>the object can either be an IRI or literal data.</li>
</ul>
