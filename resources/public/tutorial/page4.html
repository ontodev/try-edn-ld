<h2 id="names">Names</h2>
<p>We have the data in a convenient shape, but what does it mean? Well, there's some resource that has &quot;The Iliad&quot; as its title, and some guy named &quot;Homer&quot; who is the author of that resource. We also know from the context that it's a book.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is give names to our resources. Linked data names are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_resource_identifier">IRIs</a>: globally unique identifiers that generalize the familiar URL you see in your browser's location bar. We can use some standard names for our relations from the <a href="http://dublincore.org">Dublin Core</a> metadata standard, and we'll make up some more.</p>
